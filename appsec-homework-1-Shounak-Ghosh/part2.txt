 crash1.gft – Out-of-Bounds Write
- Bug Type: Buffer Overflow / Out-of-Bounds Write
- Trigger: Moves the memory pointer  beyond the allocated buffer using 0x03 (move forward by 127).
- Effect: Writes 255 to an invalid memory location with 0x02 (write value at mptr), potentially corrupting adjacent memory or causing a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV).
- Fix: Perform bound-checking on the memory pointer and throw an error if there is a out-of-bounds access.

crash2.gft – Invalid Program Counter (PC) Jump
- Bug Type: Out-of-Bounds Execution (JMP to Invalid Memory)
- Trigger: Uses 0x09 (jump) to move the instruction pointer backwards by 128 bytes, possibly outside the allocated buffer.
- Effect: Causes undefined behavior: BUS on unknown address
- Fix: Perform bound-checking on the program counter and throw an error if there is a out-of-bounds access.

hang.gft – Infinite Loop
- Bug Type: Infinite Execution Loop
- Trigger: Uses 3 NOPs followed by 0x09\xFD\x00 (jump back by -3), creating an infinite loop.
- Effect: The program hangs indefinitely, causing high CPU usage.
- Fix: Implemented a program step counter and exit(1) once steps exceed a given threshold
