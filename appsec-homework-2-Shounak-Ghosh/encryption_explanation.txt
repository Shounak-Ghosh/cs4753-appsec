Key Management
I followed the CLI instructions to set up a Github secret key using the following command: gh secret set SECRET_NAME. I also stored the secret value in .env as per the instructions. I also modified the Github Actions workflow to load the environment variable before repository checkout. These steps allowed me to safely delete the SECRET_KEY variable from settings.py while maintaining the same functionality.

Database Encryption
Using the hint suggestions, I installed the djfernet package (and updated requirements.txt) and imported it in models.py. I then modified the data field in the Card class to an EncryptedField and introduced a new field, data_hash, which is a CharField of max size 64. I also introduced an overriding save() method that populates data_hash with a hash of the data on any database save/update. I then modified use_card_view() in views.py to first hash the uploaded card data. This hash is used to query against all cards. If the card is found in the database, it is retrieved using the data_hash (previously retrieved using data, which is no longer possible as the encryption does not allow for exact lookup). In general, any operations requiring card retrieval should be performed using data_hash, instead of the actual data.
